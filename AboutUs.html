  <h2 style="color:deepskyblue">About Us</h2>
<p style="border: 7px solid dodgerblue;">As a child I was always Interested in how technology worked and I still am. Over time I homed what I was interested in and that was the internals of technology and gaming devices. Overtime and research  I started repairs on technology and fixed my first gaming device in 2023; sadly I failed and broke the screen ribbon cable, but after a while I found what I did wrong and fixed my mistake growing as a person and personal experience as a whole. I intend to expand my knowledge to some newer devices like ps3 focusing on technology that has done extensive research done by the community of people who want to fix things as well. Now I know Im not the best person when it comes to repairs but I know and understand at a level beyond the majority and tend to teach and post my findings. My knowledge, experience and understanding of technology puts me ahead of the majority knowing how to fix unknown problems like red rings of death, dead pixels, water damage. If knowing how to change and fix majority of problems on older technology.</p>
